    return `You are classifying a Chilean document upload.

Return only documents that are physically present as their own visible document, form, certificate, statement, card, or report.
Classify the upload by the dominant standalone document it represents; do not mine internal pages for every possible doctype.
Do NOT classify a doctype merely because its name, topic, or supporting data is mentioned inside another document.
Do NOT classify loose interior excerpts, clauses, annex pages, tables, or fragments unless they have their own visible title/header/issuer as a standalone document.
Prefer omission over guessing. If a page is uncertain, omit it; uncovered PDF pages will become no-clasificado.

${isPdf ? `PDF range rules:
- "start" and "end" are 1-indexed inclusive page ranges.
- One physical/logical document gets one row spanning all its pages.
- Multi-page certificates/reports/cards remain one row; do not split by page.
- If a blank, near-blank, or scanner-artifact page appears immediately after a classified document and before any new visible document begins, include it in the previous document's range; no document starts on a blank page.
- Multiple recurring instances, such as monthly liquidaciones or annual SII forms, get separate rows with disjoint ranges and their own docdate.
- Do not return two different non-container doctypes for the exact same page range. Choose the one best supported by visible title/issuer/layout.
- Container PDFs such as carpeta-tributaria return one row whose page range covers the pages actually present in this upload when the upload presents as that container (visible title/cover/header or multiple consecutive container pages). Do not extrapolate the range beyond the last visible page (a 4-page extract of a carpeta is @1..4, not @1..12). A lone interior page without the container title/header should be classified by its visible standalone content.
- Child emission applies ONLY when the parent doctype's line in this prompt's Doctypes list literally shows a "contains=[...]" meta block. If the parent doctype has no "contains=[...]" meta, it is NOT a container and this rule does NOT apply — do not carve out interior children from it. When the parent IS a container, ALSO emit each child id that literally appears in that parent's "contains=[...]" list AND that appears in this upload AS ITS OWN STANDALONE FORM (own visible title/header/issuer page that satisfies the child's own useWhen/signals/rejectWhen). Use the child's own page range, not the container's. Any id not listed in the parent's "contains=[...]" is never a child of that parent and must not be emitted as such. Examples for carpeta-tributaria (contains=[declaracion-anual-impuestos, resumen-boletas-sii]): a printed Form 22 page with the visible 'REPUBLICA DE CHILE / SERVICIO DE IMPUESTOS INTERNOS FORM. 22' + 'AÑO TRIBUTARIO YYYY' header is a separate declaracion-anual-impuestos row; an annual SII honorarios summary header is a separate resumen-boletas-sii row. The carpeta's table-of-contents lines, F29 monthly lists, or section titles are NOT standalone children — they remain covered by the carpeta row only.
- Long legal packets and certified notarial deed copies are dominant-document uploads: return one compraventa-propiedad row for the whole packet/reproduced range unless the file clearly contains separate uploaded requirements. compraventa-propiedad has no "contains=[...]" meta — it is NOT a container, so the child-emission rule above does NOT apply to it. Do not carve out mortgage clauses, SII tables, certificates (no-matrimonio, CMF informe-deuda, resumen-boletas-sii), appraisals, bank-looking annexes, or signatures inside that deed as separate documents, even if those interior pages look like standalone forms on their own.
` : ''}Cedula rule:
- If both faces of cedula-identidad are visible in one ${isPdf ? 'page' : 'image'}, return two cedula-identidad rows with different partId ("front" and "back").
- If only one face is visible, return one row with that partId when clear.

Date rule:
- "docdate" is YYYY-MM-DD for the period/emission date the document corresponds to, not access/download date.

Output:
- JSON only: {"documents":[...]}.
- Omit entries with confidence < 0.5.
- Do not use filenames as evidence.

Doctypes:
Each doctype is one line "id: definition", optionally followed by indented hints:
- useWhen: this doctype IS the dominant standalone document
- signals: literal visual cues printed on the page (titles, logos, chrome)
- rejectWhen: when NOT to use it
- vs <other-id>: how to decide between this doctype and a look-alike one
